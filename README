== Welcome to NothingCalendar
  This project aims to help tracking arbitrary events. Such as working out every day, quiting smoking, reading, writing, or whatever chain you are currently working on. It is inspired by the popular Seinfeld don't break the chain concept. It also was based originally on Calendar about Nothing, which implements the don't break the chain concept for commiting to open source. I wanted to track keeping a chain alive for things other than open source so this project began.

  Goals:
    * Simple shared chain calendar
    * full mobile support
    * full offline mode (installable as html5 app, offline syncing, etc)
    * possible phonegap compatibility for native android / iphone app.

**TODOS**
  * possibly go back to live link (can't return false) but not always updating links
  * sync with rails DB / user account
  * shareable urls
  * multiple track chains (tagging on chains)
  * different concept of goal (not every day but twice a week (Erin's feature))
  * add to igoogle
  * possible osx widget
  * android widget
  * full api support

**Notes**
  * Added devise
    * thought after page load, ajax in login info
    * if not logged in let them know they must login for server side syncing
    * if logged in return logged in as who and switch accounts
    * if a cookie expires or is cleared but there is local storage don't clear it, next time they log in compare if the server or local storage has more recent activity and take most recent activity
    * switching accounts / logout clears local storage
    * login takes most recent activity and offers link to restore from server
    * server can just store activity time and marks hash on user account
    * logged out case doesn't attempt sync, but provides notif
    * if sync attemtped when logged out server returns error which displays notif
