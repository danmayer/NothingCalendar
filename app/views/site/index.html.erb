    To get better at something, simply work on it <em>EVERY</em>
    day. For example, if your goal is to exercise more:
    <ol class="example"'>
      <li>exercise today</li>
      <li>click today's date on the calendar</li>
      <li>repeat tomorrow</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    NothingCalendar lets users track events -- anything they feel like tracking over time. Mark off days you worked out, kept to your diet, worked on your writing, studied, didn't smoke, or anything else.

    The concept of "don't break the chain" comes
